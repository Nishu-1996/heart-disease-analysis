# Heart Disease Analysis Project
This project aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease using machine learning techniques.

# Objective
To build a predictive model that identifies heart disease risk based on medical attributes.

# DataSet - The dataset contains patient health information like- 
- Age
- Sex
- Cp
- trestbps
- ca (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)
- Chol
- fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar)
- Restecg (Resting Electrocardiographic Results)
- thalach (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)
- exang (Exercise Induced Angina)

# Tools Used.
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
-
